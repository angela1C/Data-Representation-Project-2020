* An understanding of REST API:
    - Creating a rest API
    - Writing the server
* Consuming a REST API
    -  Writing a program in either Python or JavaScript that consumes an API, either your own API or a third party.
* Creating a Web Interface

### Option A: Web Application Project

A rehash of the sample project lab, I will do in Topic09-linking to db, but with your own data, i.e:

1. A basic Flask server that has a
2. REST API, (to perform CRUD operations)
3. One database table and
4. Accompanying web interface, using AJAX
calls, to perform these CRUD operations

- With  more than one table
- With authorisation (loggin in)
- User error checking, logs, hosting. Something that can be published.
- Have the webpage look nice
- A more complicated API
- Linking to some third party API
- Hosted online using for example Azure, PythonAnywhere

### Option B: Third Party API project
- Linking to a third-party API
- Storing the data in a database
- Creating a webpage to view that information. (may not be necessary if you are outputting to another API or an excel spreadsheet)
- Performing some update function through the API (Create, update, Delete).
- A fully working application

Do not overcomment the code
- A good GitHub layout with a README
